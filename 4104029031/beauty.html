[BELLE]
Little town, it's a quiet village
Every day like the one before
Little town, full of little people
Waking up to say

[ENSEMBLE]
Bonjour! Bonjour!
Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!

[BELLE]
There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor, provincial town

[MONSIEUR JEAN, spoken]
Good Morning, Belle!

[BELLE, spoken]
Good morning, Monsieur Jean
Have you lost something again?

[MONSIEUR JEAN, spoken]
Well, I believe I have
Problem is, I've—I can't remember what
Oh well, I'm sure it'll come to me
Where are you off to?

[BELLE]
To return this book to Père Robert
It's about two lovers in fair Verona

[MONSIEUR JEAN, spoken]
Sounds boring
</p><p class="p2">
[ENSEMBLE]
Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?
Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Bonjour! Good day! How is your family?
Bonjour! Good day! How is your wife?
I need six eggs! That's too expensive!

[BELLE]
There must be more than this provincial life!

[PERE ROBERT, spoken]
Ahh, if it isn't the only bookworm in town!
So, where did you run off to this week?

[BELLE, spoken]
Two cities in Northern Italy
I didn't want to come back
Have you got any new places to go?

[PERE ROBERT, spoken]
I'm afraid not...
But you may re-read any of the old ones that you'd like

[BELLE, spoken]
Your library makes our small corner of the world feel big

[PERE ROBERT, spoken]
Bon voyage!

[ENSEMBLE]
Look there she goes, the girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

[BELLE]
Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favourite part because—you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til Chapter Three!

[ENSEMBLE]
Now it's no wonder that her name means "Beauty"
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very diff'rent from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle!
</p><p class="p3">
[GASTON, spoken]
Look at her, LeFou—my future wife
Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That makes her the best

[LEFOU, spoken]
But she's so... well-read!
And you're so... athletically inclined

[GASTON, spoken]
Yes... But ever since the war, I've felt like I've been missing something.
And she's the only girl that gives me that sense of—

[LEFOU, spoken]
Mmm... je ne sais quoi?

[GASTON, spoken]
I don't know what that means

(sung)
Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town, there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

[ENSEMBLE]
Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still, my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!
</p><p class="p4">
[WOMAN 1]
Bonjour!

[GASTON]
Pardon

[BELLE]
Good day

[WOMAN 2]
Mais oui!

[WOMAN 3]
You call this bacon?

[WOMAN 4]
What lovely flowers!

[Man 1]
Some cheese

[WOMAN 5]
Ten yards!

[MAN 1]
One pound

[GASTON]
Excuse me

[CHEESE MERCHANT]
I'll get the knife

[GASTON]
Please let me through!

[WOMAN 6]
This bread

[WOMAN 7]
Those fish

[WOMAN 6]
It's stale!

[WOMAN 7]
They smell!

[MEN]
Madame's mistaken

[WOMEN]
Well, maybe so

[BELLE]
There must be more than this provincial life!

[GASTON]
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

[ENSEMBLE]
Look there she goes
That girl is strange but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!

It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle!
